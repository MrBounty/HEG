# Building an App with the HEG Tech Stack
Simple webapp tech stack without JS

## Introduction
You might feel overwhelmed by the variety of frameworks and libraries available to do frontend. They all seem to perform the same basic task: updating text when a button is clicked. Yet, the complexity is daunting, with countless frameworks, enormous libraries, and extensive boilerplate code.

In this landscape, JavaScript is unavoidable. Whether you like it or not, mastering a JavaScript framework like React or Angular is often seen as essential. However, for those who prefer simplicity and minimalism, there is an alternative: HTMX.

## Stack Philosophy: Simplicity
The HEG tech stack is built on simplicity. My definition of simplicity is straightforward: code that can be understood without documentation and minimal comments in less than five seconds. This philosophy guided my choice of technologies.

## The HEG Tech Stack

### Go (Golang)
Go, developed by Google, embodies simplicity and productivity. Its fast compilation times make it ideal for rapid development. While not the best in any specific category, Go excels in overall performance and ease of use.

### EdgeDB
EdgeDB is a modern database designed with developer experience in mind. Its queries integrate seamlessly with Go, using similar data structures and types. EdgeDB simplifies complex SQL queries and offers numerous quality-of-life features.

### HTMX
HTMX allows you to handle user inputs by sending requests to the server and updating parts of the HTML using attributes. This reduces the need for complex JavaScript frameworks for apps with small to medium interactivity. While HTMX does not eliminate JavaScript entirely, it significantly reduces the amount required.
